# NodeJS Test Task

The main goal of the task is to show your skills in the best way possible. Please use interfaces, write both unit- and functional tests and test your code locally so that it runs. 

## Part one - nodeJS rest API
You should implement a nodeJS server API communicating with this: https://reqres.in/ API. Your API should have three endpoints:
* GET http://localhost:3000/api/user/{userId} - This will make a request to https://reqres.in/api/users/{userId} and returns an user JSON representation.

* GET http://localhost:3000/api/user/{userId}/avatar - This will make a request to get the image by `avatar` URL. It should do 2 things: Save the image into the FileSystem (plain file) and return back base64 image representation. When another request with the same URL comes in, the server should not make a HTTP call to get the image, but should return the previously saved file in base64 format.

* DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/user/{userId}/avatar - This will remove the file from the FileSystem storage. When a new GET http://localhost:3000/api/user/{userId} comes in, it requires a new HTTP call to get image and has to save to the fileSystem (plain file).

*We will run `npm start` to start server and check the results.*

## Part two - implement a CRON job to scrap the users
Use this: https://reqres.in/api/users?page={page} to get the list of users and store them into a file in JSON Format. Each 1 minute a cron job should scrap the next page and append users into existing file in JSON format.

*We will need to be able to run `npm run scrap` in order to start the cron and check the results.
Please use TypeScript typing where possible and fill free to add tests. Good luck!*
